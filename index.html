            <p>exercise can help protect you from heart disease and stroke, high blood pressure, noninsulin-dependent
                diabetes, obesity, back pain, osteoporosis, and can improve your mood and help you to better manage
                stress.For the greatest overall health benefits, experts recommend that you do 20 to 30 minutes of
                aerobic activity three or more times a week and some type of muscle strengthening activity and
                stretching at least twice a week.As you age, it’s important to protect your bones, joints, and muscles –
                they support your body and help you move. Keeping bones, joints, and muscles healthy can help ensure
                that you’re able to do your daily activities and be physically active. Doing aerobic,
                muscle-strengthening, and bone-strengthening physical activity at a moderately-intense level can slow
                the loss of bone density that comes with age.

                Hip fracture is a serious health condition that can have life-changing negative effects, especially if
                you’re an older adult. Physically active people have a lower risk of hip fracture than inactive people.

            <h1> About Me</h1>
            <p> Exercise can help prevent excess weight gain or help maintain weight loss. When you engage in physical
                activity, you burn calories. The more intense the activity, the more calories you burn.

                Regular trips to the gym are great, but don't worry if you can't find a large chunk of time to exercise
                every day. Any amount of activity is better than none at all. To reap the benefits of exercise, just get
                more active throughout your day — take the stairs instead of the elevator or rev up your household
                chores. Consistency is key.</p>
